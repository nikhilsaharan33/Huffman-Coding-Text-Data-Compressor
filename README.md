# Text-Data-Compressor-(Huffman-Coding)
This is a lossless text data compressor which uses Huffman Coding to compress any text data.

* Run the huffman.py file and add paths/file names as directed by the console. 
* In order to compress a file, you will need a text file in your device. This will generate a file with ".bin" extension along with a CSV file which will have the encodings of the characters.
* In order to decompress a file, you will need a CSV file which will have the encodings of the characters along with a ".bin" file to be decompressed.
